# Interoperabilty framework extended by RA-SKG

{: .important }
To prevent possible clashes with other extensions, each extension is assigned a unique prefix (e.g., the acronym you provided upon requesting an extension) that you need to prepend when defining new properties and relations for core entities.

## Core extensions
RA-SKG extends these core entities:
- [Research product] is extended by [RA-SKG research product]
- [Agent] is extended by [RA-SKG Agent]



## Extension entities (To be removed?)
RA-SKG introduces a [New entity].
