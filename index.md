# RA-SKG extension

The RA-SKG extension has been developed in the context of the EU project [GraspOS](https://graspos.eu) in order to support Responsible Research Assessment practices.

The extensions supports the injection of indicators and other kinds of metrics for both the core entities [Research product] and [Agent]. Furthermore, it enables the creation of personal narratives by linking together diverse [Research products] into common narrative sections.
