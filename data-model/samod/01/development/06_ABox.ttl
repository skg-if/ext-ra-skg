With over a decade of experience in academic and collaborative industry projects, I have cultivated a multidisciplinary approach, integrating chemistry, materials science, and environmental studies to drive innovation in sustainable materials. Throughout my career, I have been committed to fostering an inclusive and collaborative research environment. By mentoring early-career researchers, supervising diverse teams, and organizing training programs, I have supported others in achieving their potential while ensuring knowledge transfer across generations of scientists. Beyond my research contributions, I actively engage with the wider scientific and public communities to amplify the impact of my work. Whether through advising policymakers on sustainable packaging legislation or participating in outreach programs to inspire young minds, I strive to bridge the gap between science and society."

I led the “Sustainable Polymers Initiative,” a collaborative research project funded by the European Research Council, which developed a novel polymer blend with 50% lower environmental impact compared to traditional plastics. This research has been widely cited and has attracted industrial interest, leading to a joint patent with GreenPack Ltd. Supervising a diverse group of PhD students and postdoctoral researchers, I have fostered innovation and collaboration, resulting in four students winning national awards for their research excellence."

I have organized annual training workshops on advanced polymer synthesis techniques, attracting participants from academic and industrial backgrounds. These workshops have been instrumental in equipping attendees with practical skills and fostering industry-academia collaborations. Additionally, I co-developed an undergraduate internship program within my department, which has provided hands-on research opportunities to over 30 students, many of whom have progressed to postgraduate studies."

The biodegradable polymer developed in the Sustainable Polymers Initiative is now being scaled up by GreenPack Ltd., with the potential to replace traditional plastics in 20% of European food packaging markets by 2030. To raise public awareness, I have participated in science communication initiatives such as the BBC series Future Materials, explaining the role of sustainable materials in tackling climate change. I also contribute regularly to outreach programs in local schools, inspiring young students to pursue careers in STEM fields. In 2022, I collaborated with policymakers to draft recommendations for sustainable packaging legislation, which influenced the European Union’s “Green Materials Directive."

        tbox:hasContent "The complexity of molecular behavior in biological systems presents a significant challenge for drug design. My research aims to understand and leverage the dual nature of certain molecular systems, which can exhibit distinct functional states depending on environmental or structural conditions. This work addresses the need for more precise and adaptable pharmaceutical agents that minimize side effects while maximizing therapeutic efficacy. This line of research focuses on characterizing “switchable” biomolecules—compounds that can toggle between active and inactive states in response to stimuli like pH, light, or enzymatic interactions. By employing computational chemistry, structural biology, and experimental validation, I explore how these molecules interact with cellular pathways to enable targeted and dynamic drug delivery systems. This research has improved the understanding of molecular duality, paving the way for next-generation drugs that respond dynamically to the body’s needs. These findings have influenced early-stage pharmaceutical development and contributed to interdisciplinary collaborations between biophysics and pharmacology." ;

My research investigates how AI models can be designed to prioritize ethical considerations, such as bias reduction, explainability, and equitable data representation, while maintaining scientific rigor and innovation. This work focuses on creating ethical frameworks for the development and application of AI in biochemical data analysis. It involves training neural networks on curated datasets, developing algorithms that emphasize interpretability, and implementing safeguards to prevent biased or unreliable predictions in drug discovery and diagnostics. This research has enhanced the reliability and trustworthiness of AI in biochemical applications, fostering more widespread adoption of these tools across academia and industry. It has also influenced discussions around the ethical implications of AI, contributing to the formulation of policy recommendations for its use in life sciences." ;
