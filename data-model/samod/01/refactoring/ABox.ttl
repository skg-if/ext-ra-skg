To raise public awareness, I have participated in science communication initiatives such as the BBC series Future Materials, explaining the role of sustainable materials in tackling climate change. I also contribute regularly to outreach programs in local schools, inspiring young students to pursue careers in STEM fields. In 2022, I collaborated with policymakers to draft recommendations for sustainable packaging legislation, which influenced the European Union’s “Green Materials Directive." ],

My research investigates how AI models can be designed to prioritize ethical considerations, such as bias reduction, explainability, and equitable data representation, while maintaining scientific rigor and innovation. This work focuses on creating ethical frameworks for the development and application of AI in biochemical data analysis. It involves training neural networks on curated datasets, developing algorithms that emphasize interpretability, and implementing safeguards to prevent biased or unreliable predictions in drug discovery and diagnostics. This research has enhanced the reliability and trustworthiness of AI in biochemical applications, fostering more widespread adoption of these tools across academia and industry. It has also influenced discussions around the ethical implications of AI, contributing to the formulation of policy recommendations for its use in life sciences." ;

My research aims to understand and leverage the dual nature of certain molecular systems, which can exhibit distinct functional states depending on environmental or structural conditions. This work addresses the need for more precise and adaptable pharmaceutical agents that minimize side effects while maximizing therapeutic efficacy. This line of research focuses on characterizing “switchable” biomolecules—compounds that can toggle between active and inactive states in response to stimuli like pH, light, or enzymatic interactions. By employing computational chemistry, structural biology, and experimental validation, I explore how these molecules interact with cellular pathways to enable targeted and dynamic drug delivery systems. This research has improved the understanding of molecular duality, paving the way for next-generation drugs that respond dynamically to the body’s needs. These findings have influenced early-stage pharmaceutical development and contributed to interdisciplinary collaborations between biophysics and pharmacology." ;
